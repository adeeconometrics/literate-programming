        "\n",
        "Data processing and using descriptive methods to retrieve relevant information have been used to manage different sorts of events such as taxes, tallying voting scores, wars and so on. Today, thanks to the development of probability theory, these mere descriptions can be extended to deal uncertain events such as decision-making and forecasting, and extract relevant features which we can generalize under some sufficient amount of collected data.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In that note, there are two main departments of statistics:(1) descriptive statistics which merely describes some feature about the data it is usually composed with those methods concerned with collecting and describing a set of data so as to lead to a meaningful information, and (2) inferential statistics which comprises those methods concerned with the analysis of a subset of data leading to **predictions** (or inferences) about the entire set of data. \n",
        "\n",
        "As you may wonder, the generalizations associated with statistical inferences are *always* subject to uncertainties. In dealing with such *uncertain* events, we use our understanding of probability theory (which is a subject for a separate discussion).\n",

        "Although this notebook is not exclusively made for a statistician, it is helpful to imagine ourselves as practitioners of statistics and emphathize to the problems faced by statisticians. \n",
        "\n",
        "Statistical analysis provide us the power to test claims or assumptions and subject them into the light of finding *validity*. There is an intellectual discourse that talk about the rigour of this subject, however, we will not adress those philosophical issues in this notebook. \n",

        "    - Parameter -  numerical summary or any measurement coming from a **population**\n",
        "- Sample - group of subject selected from a **population**\n",
        "    - Statistic - measure of the sample\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data and Variables \n",
        "Here we define the basic types (or forms) that our data or variables can embody.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "- Quantitaitve - A broad category that includes any variable that can be counted, or has a numerical value associated with it. Examples of variables that fall into this category include discrete variables and ratio variables.\n",

        "### Sampling Techniques \n",
        "In determining the sample size- typically we use samples of the population and not the population itsel because of the tremendous cost of in doing so. Instead, we rely on several techniques of sampling to get the best approximation of the behavior (or the trends) that are manifested by our population. \n",
        "\n",
        "To determine the *sufficient* sample size from a given population, the **Slovin's Formula** is usually used which is defined as follows: $$n= \\frac{N}{1+Ne^2}$$\n",
