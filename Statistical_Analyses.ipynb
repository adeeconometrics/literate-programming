        "SciPy  is a Python-based ecosystem of open-source software for mathematics, science, and engineering. It provides an array of computatioanl tools written in [C](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/cprogramming/index.htm) and [Fortran](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/fortran/fortran_overview.htm) for high-performance codebase and interfaced with a python package. To install SciPy if you already have Python installed in your system, type: ``\n",
        "python -m pip install --user numpy scipy matplotlib ipython jupyter pandas sympy nose``. in your command line interface (CLI). For other cases, [refer to the documation](https://www.scipy.org/install.html).\n",

        "A probability distribution is a mathematical function that outputs the possibilities of occurrence of different possible outcomes for an experiment; It is a mathematical description of a random phenomenon in terms of its sample space and the probabilities of events (subsets of the sample space).\n",
        "\n",
        "The sample space, often denoted by $\\Omega$ , is the set of all possible outcomes of a random phenomenon being observed; it may be any set: a set of real numbers, a set of vectors, a set of arbitrary non-numerical values, etc. \n",
        "\n",
        "To define probability distributions for the specific case of random variables (so the sample space can be seen as a numeric set), it is common to distinguish between **discrete** and **continuous** random variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "### General Definition \n",
        "Since probability distributions can be has alternative definitions, one of the most general descriptions, which applies for continuous and discrete variables, is by means of a probability function ${\\displaystyle P\\colon {\\mathcal {A}}\\rightarrow \\mathbb {R} } $ whose input space ${\\mathcal {A}}$ is related to the sample space, and gives a probability as its output.\n",
