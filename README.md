# literate-programming
A project for exploring and interfacing with science through concepts, examples and code. 
This project is aimed to explain, explore, and have fun with scientific concepts. 
I indend this to be a stepping stone for more more specialized sciences.

- Discrete Maths
- Elementary Statistics
- Intermediate Statistical Analysis
