        "## Conceptions of Probability\n",
        "The study of Probability can be an unsettling course, especially if you were used to deductive reasoning like classical logic, or geometry. But probability rewards us to deal with uncertain events and formally reason about them. Probability has been involved with lots of controversies on the matter regarding its principles and schools of thoughts. The formalisation of the field was achieved by three primary axioms called the [Kolmogorov Axioms](https://bityl.co/45fQ). \n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook will not introduce the axiomatic version of probability theory, instead it shall provide us an intuitive understanding, as well as familiarity with the concepts tailored in probability theory. To get back with the axiomatic foundations, it is sufficient, given the purpose of this notebook, to think about the Kolmogorov axioms as the concepts that glues probability as a formal piece of mathematics were one can use logic to deal with uncertain events.  \n",
        "\n",
        "For this section, I shall introduce you to some assertions on probabilities. First, what do we mean by probability? **Probability pertains to the likelihood of occurrence of an even** We can assert probability in three ways:\n",
        "1. Subjective Probability - which takes a wild guess about the chances of an occurrence e.g. beliefs, opinion, educated guess, intuition, etc. \n",
        "2. Classical Probability -  are applied when all possible outcomes are *equally likely to happen*\n",
        "3. Empirical Probability -  are assigned based on the prior knowledge of events i.e. based from research experiments\n",

        " If an operation (or relationships) can be perfomed (or combined) in $n_1$ ways, and for each of these, a second operation can be performed in $n_2$ ways, then the result of combining the two operations is: $n_1 \\times n_2$. \n",
        "\n",
        " Note: The generalization of this rule is achieved by adding subsequent operations $n_1, ..., n_k$ which translates to $n_1 \\times, ..., \\times n_k$ operations. \n",

        " It is important to realize that permutation concerns about arrangements of sets (with order) while combinations does not regard order. These concepts should be distinguished first for it can be confusing from the everyday use of the term *combination* what we really mean is *permutation*. For instance, the combination of our password, taken from the meaning we ought to ascribe in this context, can imply that the orders $1,2,3 \\equiv 3,2,1 \\equiv 2,1,3 ...$, In other words, the correct combination of numbers regardless of their order shall be deemed as valid. \n",
        "\n",
        "  As we mentioned above, **permutation** pertains to an ordered arrangement of all part of a set of objects. There are different ways we can make sense of permutations, but more generally, the formula for permutations is expressed as $P_{n}^{r} = \\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}$\n",
